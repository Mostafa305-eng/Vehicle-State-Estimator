Vehicle State Estimator (Estimator ECU)

The current time will be injected only once from a PC using UART (TTL) to Estimator ECU.
There are two buttons to increase or decrease the speed of the Vehicle then when ECU receives an external signal from measurement ECU, it will send the data to measurement ECU.
